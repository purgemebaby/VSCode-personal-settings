### üìã Description

As you can see in the description, here is a .json file customized for your VSCode Editor. I will comment on it to give a brief
explanation of what it does every feature on this file. Also, since this is my usual code editor, I'll prolly add more settings
related to extensions and shortcuts.

### üìö Setup and install
1. Go to [this repository](https://github.com/purgemebaby/VSCode-personal-settings).
2. Click __"Code"__ to reveal the HTTPS, GitHub CLI or Download ZIP option.
3. Open up your system __GitBash__ (Windows) or your own Linux/GNU terminal, setup a location that suits you better.
4. Clone the repository to your actual work directory (if you don't know use `pwd`) and use `git clone https://github.com/purgemebaby/VSCode-personal-settings.git`.
5. Now you can download the .json and open VSCode.
6. Finally, there is an option on VSCode on settings to see them as a .json file. Open it and then copy the code of the custom one and paste.
7. As a suggestion, breakdown and investigate every setting in this file, search by your own to make a comfy environment to work and enjoy it.
